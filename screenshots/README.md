### Taking Screenshots

#### Best Practices:
1. **Full Browser Window**: Capture entire browser window
2. **Clear Navigation**: Show AWS service navigation
3. **Relevant Tabs**: Focus on important configuration tabs
4. **Zoom Level**: Use 100% zoom for clarity
5. **Clean Interface**: Close unnecessary browser tabs/windows

#### Tools Recommended:
- **macOS**: Cmd+Shift+4 (selection) or Cmd+Shift+3 (full screen)
- **Windows**: Snipping Tool or Win+Shift+S
- **Linux**: gnome-screenshot or scrot
- **Browser Extensions**: Awesome Screenshot, Lightshot

### Validation Process

#### Step 1: Pre-Screenshot
- Deploy infrastructure completely
- Verify all services are running
- Test API endpoints
- Confirm monitoring is active

#### Step 2: Capture Screenshots
- Follow the numbered sequence
- Validate each screenshot against checklist
- Retake if quality is insufficient
- Ensure no sensitive data is visible

#### Step 3: Post-Screenshot
- Review all screenshots for completeness
- Verify against validation requirements
- Update documentation if needed
- Store in version control

### Integration with Documentation

These screenshots should be referenced in:
- `PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Main validation guide
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Deployment verification
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Architecture validation
- `README.md` - Quick validation reference

### Compliance Notes

For HIPAA compliance:
- Ensure no PHI (Protected Health Information) is visible
- Use only test/demo data in screenshots
- Redact any sensitive configuration details
- Follow organizational screenshot policies

### Troubleshooting Screenshot Issues

#### Common Problems:
1. **Blurry Images**: Increase resolution, use 100% zoom
2. **Missing Information**: Expand panels, scroll to show all content
3. **Wrong Configuration**: Verify deployment before screenshots
4. **Security Concerns**: Review and redact sensitive information

#### Solutions:
- Use browser developer tools to adjust display
- Take multiple screenshots if content doesn't fit
- Use annotation tools to highlight important areas
- Implement screenshot review process
