# Load Testing Results

**Screenshot**: `14-load-testing.png`

## What to Capture
Load testing tool (Apache Bench, JMeter, etc.) showing performance results

## Validation Checklist
- ✅ API handles 1000+ concurrent requests
- ✅ Response times remain under 2 seconds
- ✅ No 5XX errors under normal load
- ✅ Lambda auto-scaling working
- ✅ DynamoDB handling load without throttling

## Expected Performance Metrics
```
Concurrent Users: 100
Requests/Second: 500
Average Response Time: <1000ms
Error Rate: <1%
Throughput: Stable under load
```

## Screenshot Requirements
- Show load testing results
- Performance graphs visible
- Response time distribution
- Error rate statistics
- Throughput measurements

## Validation Notes
This screenshot proves:
- System scalability
- Performance under load
- Auto-scaling functionality
- Production readiness
